# Brainstorming Session Results

**Date:** February 17, 2026

## Session Overview

**Topic:** AI Highlight Selector - intelligent system for automatically selecting and explaining game highlights based on user preferences

**Goals:** 
- Design selection logic and algorithms for highlight worthiness scoring
- Define robust input/output data structures
- Create meaningful explanation generation strategies
- Handle user preferences intelligently with personalization
- Focus on pure logic without video processing complexity

### Context Guidance

**Project Focus Areas:** Software and product development with emphasis on:
- User problems and pain points in highlight selection
- Feature ideas and capabilities for intelligent curation
- Technical approaches for scoring and ranking algorithms
- User experience for preference expression and result presentation
- Business value through personalized sports content
- Market differentiation via AI-powered selection
- Technical risks in accuracy and user satisfaction
- Success metrics for selection quality and engagement

### Existing Project Assets

**Input Documentation:**
- Feature overview: `/shared/feature_overview.md` - Comprehensive specification of the AI Highlight Selector
- Sample data: `/shared/sample_data.json` - NBA Finals Game 7 event data with full schema examples

**Key Design Elements Already Defined:**
- Event importance levels (critical > high > medium > low)
- User preference structure (favorite player/team)
- Scoring factors: importance, preference match, event type weight, clutch factor, diversity
- Output format: ranked highlights with scores and explanations

### Session Setup

This brainstorming session will build upon the existing feature specification to explore deeper design considerations, edge cases, algorithm improvements, and innovative approaches to intelligent highlight selection.

## Technique Selection

**Approach:** Hybrid Progressive Flow (AI-Recommended + User-Controlled Journey)
**Selection Rationale:** Custom-designed journey combining AI analysis with progressive development methodology

**Analysis Context:** Technical logic design requiring both creative algorithm innovation and systematic problem-solving for scoring systems, personalization, and explanation generation.

**Progressive Journey Design (60-75 minutes):**

### Phase 1: Expansive Exploration (15-20 min)
**Technique: SCAMPER Method** (Structured/Creative)
- **Purpose:** Systematically explore existing highlight selection algorithm through 7 innovation lenses
- **Expected Outcome:** 20-30+ algorithm variations, scoring improvements, and feature ideas
- **Why Selected:** Perfect for methodically innovating on established design patterns (Substitute scoring factors, Combine algorithms, Adapt from other domains, Modify weighting)

### Phase 2: Pattern Recognition (10-15 min)
**Technique: Mind Mapping** (Structured/Visual)
- **Purpose:** Organize generated ideas into thematic clusters and identify patterns
- **Expected Outcome:** Clear themes around scoring strategies, personalization approaches, explanation techniques, edge cases
- **Why Selected:** Visual organization reveals connections between disparate algorithm ideas and highlights priority areas

### Phase 3: Idea Development (20-25 min)
**Technique: First Principles Thinking** (Creative/Deep)
- **Purpose:** Strip away assumptions and rebuild top 2-3 approaches from fundamental truths
- **Expected Outcome:** Deeply refined scoring algorithms with solid logical foundations
- **Why Selected:** Essential for ensuring highlight selection logic is built on sound reasoning rather than inherited assumptions

### Phase 4: Action Planning (15-20 min)
**Technique: Solution Matrix** (Structured/Analytical)
- **Purpose:** Create systematic grid of implementation priorities (features × complexity × impact)
- **Expected Outcome:** Clear implementation roadmap with MVP definition and prioritized backlog
- **Why Selected:** Transforms creative ideas into actionable technical plan with clear next steps
