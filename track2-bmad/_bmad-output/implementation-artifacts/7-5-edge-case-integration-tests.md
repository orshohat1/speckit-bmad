# Story 7.5: Edge Case Integration Tests

Status: ready-for-dev

## Story

As a developer,
I want integration tests that verify edge case handling end-to-end,
So that the system handles all error scenarios gracefully.

## Acceptance Criteria

**Given** I have implemented all edge case handling
**When** I run the test suite
**Then** test_edge_cases.py contains tests for empty event lists

**And** tests verify null/missing preference handling

**And** tests verify unknown importance level handling

**And** tests verify missing optional field handling

**And** tests verify insufficient event scenarios

**And** tests verify malformed data handling in JSON deserialization

**And** all tests verify no crashes occur (NFR-006)

**And** tests are implemented in tests/test_edge_cases.py

**And** all tests pass successfully

**Requirements Fulfilled:** FR-017, FR-018, FR-019, FR-020, NFR-006

## Dev Notes

### Epic Context

This story is part of **Epic 7: Testing, Performance, and Quality Assurance**.

### Architecture Requirements

**Technology Stack:**
- Python 3.10+ (required for modern type hints)
- Standard library ONLY (NFR-016) - no external runtime dependencies
- Development dependencies: pytest, black, mypy (dev-time only)

**Code Quality Standards:**
1. Type hints on all functions (NFR-010, NFR-013)
2. Google-style docstrings (NFR-011)
3. Black formatting (NFR-012)
4. Pure functions for business logic (NFR-014)
5. ≥88% test coverage (NFR-009)
