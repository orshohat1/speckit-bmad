# Story 5.4: Formatted Highlight Output

Status: ready-for-dev

## Story

As a user,
I want to see highlights in a clean, formatted display,
So that I can easily scan and understand the results.

## Acceptance Criteria

**Given** I have selected highlights from the CLI
**When** I view the output
**Then** each highlight shows rank, score, player, team, quarter, and description

**And** the explanation is displayed prominently for each highlight

**And** output uses visual hierarchy (bold, spacing, indentation) for readability

**And** rank is displayed as "#1", "#2", etc.

**And** score is displayed with appropriate precision (integer or 1 decimal)

**And** highlights are separated by blank lines or dividers

**And** the output fits comfortably in a standard 80-column terminal

**And** the formatting function is implemented in cli.py

**And** the output looks professional and polished

**Requirements Fulfilled:** FR-026, NFR-020, NFR-021

## Dev Notes

### Epic Context

This story is part of **Epic 5: CLI Interface and User Experience**.

### Architecture Requirements

**Technology Stack:**
- Python 3.10+ (required for modern type hints)
- Standard library ONLY (NFR-016) - no external runtime dependencies
- Development dependencies: pytest, black, mypy (dev-time only)

**Code Quality Standards:**
1. Type hints on all functions (NFR-010, NFR-013)
2. Google-style docstrings (NFR-011)
3. Black formatting (NFR-012)
4. Pure functions for business logic (NFR-014)
5. ≥88% test coverage (NFR-009)
