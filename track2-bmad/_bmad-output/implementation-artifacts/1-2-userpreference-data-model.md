# Story 1.2: UserPreference Data Model

Status: review

## Story

As a developer,
I want a UserPreference model that captures user personalization settings,
So that I can apply scoring boosts based on user's favorite player and/or team.

## Acceptance Criteria

**Given** I am creating a new UserPreference instance
**When** I provide optional favorite_player and/or favorite_team
**Then** the UserPreference is created successfully

**And** both fields are optional (can be None)

**And** the model includes type hints using Optional[str] for both fields

**And** the model handles the case where neither preference is specified (both None)

**And** the model handles the case where only one preference is specified

**And** the model is defined as a dataclass in models.py module

**And** the model includes a docstring describing its purpose and use cases

**Requirements Fulfilled:** FR-002, NFR-010, NFR-011

  - [ ] Subtask 2.3: Validate test coverage

- [ ] Task 3: Code quality validation (AC: all)
  - [ ] Subtask 3.1: Run mypy strict mode
  - [ ] Subtask 3.2: Run black formatter
  - [ ] Subtask 3.3: Verify all acceptance criteria met

## Dev Notes

### Epic Context

This story is part of **Epic 1: Data Models and Core Types**.

### Architecture Requirements

**Technology Stack:**
- Python 3.10+ (required for modern type hints)
- Standard library ONLY (NFR-016) - no external runtime dependencies
- Development dependencies: pytest, black, mypy (dev-time only)

**Code Quality Standards:**
1. Type hints on all functions (NFR-010, NFR-013)
2. Google-style docstrings (NFR-011)
3. Black formatting (NFR-012)
4. Pure functions for business logic (NFR-014)
5. ≥88% test coverage (NFR-009)
