# Story 5.6: --only Flag Implementation

Status: ready-for-dev

## Story

As a user,
I want an --only flag that filters output to my favorite player/team exclusively,
So that I can see only the highlights that match my preference.

## Acceptance Criteria

**Given** I provide --player "Name" --only
**When** the system processes events
**Then** only highlights featuring that player are included in output

**And** critical events from other players are excluded (--only overrides force-include)

**And** the 5-8 highlight count rule is relaxed (may return fewer than 5)

**Given** I provide --team "Name" --only
**When** the system processes events
**Then** only highlights from that team are included in output

**And** if both --player and --team are specified with --only, both filters apply (AND logic)

**And** the flag is implemented in cli.py

**And** appropriate filtering happens after initial selection but before output

**Requirements Fulfilled:** FR-024, NFR-021

## Dev Notes

### Epic Context

This story is part of **Epic 5: CLI Interface and User Experience**.

### Architecture Requirements

**Technology Stack:**
- Python 3.10+ (required for modern type hints)
- Standard library ONLY (NFR-016) - no external runtime dependencies
- Development dependencies: pytest, black, mypy (dev-time only)

**Code Quality Standards:**
1. Type hints on all functions (NFR-010, NFR-013)
2. Google-style docstrings (NFR-011)
3. Black formatting (NFR-012)
4. Pure functions for business logic (NFR-014)
5. ≥88% test coverage (NFR-009)
