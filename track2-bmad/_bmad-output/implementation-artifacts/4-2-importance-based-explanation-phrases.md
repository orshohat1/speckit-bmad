# Story 4.2: Importance-Based Explanation Phrases

Status: review

## Story

As a developer,
I want explanation phrases that describe event importance naturally,
So that users understand why an event's base importance contributed to its selection.

## Acceptance Criteria

**Given** I have a GameEvent with an importance level
**When** I generate an explanation phrase for importance
**Then** "critical" events use phrases like "game-defining", "crucial moment", "deciding play"

**And** "high" events use phrases like "important moment", "key play", "significant event"

**And** "medium" events use phrases like "noteworthy play", "solid moment"

**And** "low" events use phrases like "moment from the game"

**And** phrases are returned by a function get_importance_phrase(importance)

**And** the function is implemented in selector.py

**And** the function includes type hints and a docstring

**Requirements Fulfilled:** FR-015, FR-016, NFR-008

## Tasks / Subtasks

  - [ ] Subtask 2.3: Validate test coverage

- [ ] Task 3: Code quality validation (AC: all)
  - [ ] Subtask 3.1: Run mypy strict mode
  - [ ] Subtask 3.2: Run black formatter
  - [ ] Subtask 3.3: Verify all acceptance criteria met

## Dev Notes

### Epic Context

This story is part of **Epic 4: Explanation Generation System**.

### Architecture Requirements

**Technology Stack:**
- Python 3.10+ (required for modern type hints)
- Standard library ONLY (NFR-016) - no external runtime dependencies
- Development dependencies: pytest, black, mypy (dev-time only)

**Code Quality Standards:**
1. Type hints on all functions (NFR-010, NFR-013)
2. Google-style docstrings (NFR-011)
3. Black formatting (NFR-012)
4. Pure functions for business logic (NFR-014)
5. ≥88% test coverage (NFR-009)
