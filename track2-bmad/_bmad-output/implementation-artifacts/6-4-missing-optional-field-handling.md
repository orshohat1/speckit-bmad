# Story 6.4: Missing Optional Field Handling

Status: ready-for-dev

## Story

As a developer,
I want the system to handle events with missing optional fields gracefully,
So that incomplete data doesn't cause crashes.

## Acceptance Criteria

**Given** I have a GameEvent with missing tags field (None or empty)
**When** I process the event
**Then** context_boosts returns an empty dictionary

**And** no exceptions are raised

**Given** I have a GameEvent with missing description
**When** I generate an explanation
**Then** the system uses the event type or a default phrase

**And** no exceptions are raised

**And** the handling is implemented across selector.py functions

**And** unit tests verify these edge cases

**Requirements Fulfilled:** FR-020, NFR-006

## Tasks / Subtasks

  - [ ] Subtask 1.3: Add type hints and docstrings

- [ ] Task 2: Write comprehensive tests (AC: all)
  - [ ] Subtask 2.1: Write unit tests
  - [ ] Subtask 2.2: Write integration tests (if needed)
  - [ ] Subtask 2.3: Validate test coverage

- [ ] Task 3: Code quality validation (AC: all)
  - [ ] Subtask 3.1: Run mypy strict mode
  - [ ] Subtask 3.2: Run black formatter
  - [ ] Subtask 3.3: Verify all acceptance criteria met

## Dev Notes

### Epic Context

This story is part of **Epic 6: Edge Case Handling and Validation**.

### Architecture Requirements

**Technology Stack:**
- Python 3.10+ (required for modern type hints)
- Standard library ONLY (NFR-016) - no external runtime dependencies
- Development dependencies: pytest, black, mypy (dev-time only)

**Code Quality Standards:**
1. Type hints on all functions (NFR-010, NFR-013)
2. Google-style docstrings (NFR-011)
3. Black formatting (NFR-012)
4. Pure functions for business logic (NFR-014)
5. ≥88% test coverage (NFR-009)
