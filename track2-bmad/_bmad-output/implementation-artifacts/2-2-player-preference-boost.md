# Story 2.2: Player Preference Boost

Status: review

## Story

As a developer,
I want a function that adds score boosts for events featuring the user's favorite player,
So that highlights can be personalized to user preferences.

## Acceptance Criteria

**Given** I have a GameEvent and a UserPreference with a favorite_player
**When** I call calculate_player_boost(event, preference)
**Then** I receive +30 points if the event's player matches the favorite_player

**And** I receive 0 points if the event's player does not match

**And** I receive 0 points if no favorite_player is specified (None)

**And** player name matching is case-sensitive and exact

**And** the function is implemented as a pure function in selector.py

**And** the function includes type hints and a docstring

**And** the function handles None values gracefully without errors

**Requirements Fulfilled:** FR-004, NFR-014, NFR-018

## Dev Notes

### Epic Context

This story is part of **Epic 2: Event Scoring Engine**.

### Architecture Requirements

**Technology Stack:**
- Python 3.10+ (required for modern type hints)
- Standard library ONLY (NFR-016) - no external runtime dependencies
- Development dependencies: pytest, black, mypy (dev-time only)

**Code Quality Standards:**
1. Type hints on all functions (NFR-010, NFR-013)
2. Google-style docstrings (NFR-011)
3. Black formatting (NFR-012)
4. Pure functions for business logic (NFR-014)
5. ≥88% test coverage (NFR-009)
