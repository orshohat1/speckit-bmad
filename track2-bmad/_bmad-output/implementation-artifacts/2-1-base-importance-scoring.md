# Story 2.1: Base Importance Scoring

Status: review

## Story

As a developer,
I want a function that calculates base scores from event importance levels,
So that critical plays are scored higher than routine plays.

## Acceptance Criteria

**Given** I have a GameEvent with an importance level
**When** I call calculate_base_score(event)
**Then** I receive a numeric score based on the importance mapping

**And** "critical" importance returns 100 points

**And** "high" importance returns 75 points

**And** "medium" importance returns 50 points

**And** "low" importance returns 25 points

**And** unknown or missing importance defaults to "low" (25 points)

**And** the function is implemented as a pure function in selector.py

**And** the function includes type hints and a docstring

**And** the function is deterministic (same input always returns same output)

**Requirements Fulfilled:** FR-003, FR-019, NFR-014, NFR-018

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Task 2: Write comprehensive tests (AC: all)
  - [ ] Subtask 2.1: Write unit tests
  - [ ] Subtask 2.2: Write integration tests (if needed)
  - [ ] Subtask 2.3: Validate test coverage

- [ ] Task 3: Code quality validation (AC: all)
  - [ ] Subtask 3.1: Run mypy strict mode
  - [ ] Subtask 3.2: Run black formatter
  - [ ] Subtask 3.3: Verify all acceptance criteria met

## Dev Notes

### Epic Context

This story is part of **Epic 2: Event Scoring Engine**.

### Architecture Requirements

**Technology Stack:**
- Python 3.10+ (required for modern type hints)
- Standard library ONLY (NFR-016) - no external runtime dependencies
- Development dependencies: pytest, black, mypy (dev-time only)

**Code Quality Standards:**
1. Type hints on all functions (NFR-010, NFR-013)
2. Google-style docstrings (NFR-011)
3. Black formatting (NFR-012)
4. Pure functions for business logic (NFR-014)
5. ≥88% test coverage (NFR-009)
