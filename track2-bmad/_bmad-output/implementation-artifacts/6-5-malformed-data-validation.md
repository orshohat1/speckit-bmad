# Story 6.5: Malformed Data Validation

Status: ready-for-dev

## Story

As a developer,
I want input validation that catches malformed data early,
So that users receive clear error messages rather than cryptic exceptions.

## Acceptance Criteria

**Given** I provide invalid JSON to the CLI
**When** the CLI attempts to parse it
**Then** I receive a clear error message indicating the JSON is malformed

**And** the error message suggests checking the file format

**And** the CLI exits gracefully with a non-zero exit code

**Given** I provide a dictionary missing required GameEvent fields
**When** GameEvent.from_dict() is called
**Then** an appropriate exception is raised with a clear message

**And** the validation is implemented in models.py and cli.py

**And** unit tests verify validation behavior

**Requirements Fulfilled:** NFR-006, NFR-019

  - [ ] Subtask 3.2: Run black formatter
  - [ ] Subtask 3.3: Verify all acceptance criteria met

## Dev Notes

### Epic Context

This story is part of **Epic 6: Edge Case Handling and Validation**.

### Architecture Requirements

**Technology Stack:**
- Python 3.10+ (required for modern type hints)
- Standard library ONLY (NFR-016) - no external runtime dependencies
- Development dependencies: pytest, black, mypy (dev-time only)

**Code Quality Standards:**
1. Type hints on all functions (NFR-010, NFR-013)
2. Google-style docstrings (NFR-011)
3. Black formatting (NFR-012)
4. Pure functions for business logic (NFR-014)
5. ≥88% test coverage (NFR-009)
