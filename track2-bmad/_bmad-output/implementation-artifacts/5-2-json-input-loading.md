# Story 5.2: JSON Input Loading

Status: ready-for-dev

## Story

As a user,
I want the CLI to load game events from a JSON file,
So that I can process different games without changing code.

## Acceptance Criteria

**Given** I have a JSON file with game events (e.g., sample_data.json)
**When** I run the CLI with that file as input
**Then** the system loads all events successfully

**And** the CLI reads from stdin by default (for piping: cat data.json | python cli.py)

**And** the CLI accepts a file path argument (python cli.py data.json)

**And** the CLI handles file not found errors with helpful messages

**And** the CLI validates JSON structure and reports parsing errors clearly

**And** the CLI uses GameEvent.from_dict() to deserialize events

**And** the implementation is in cli.py module

**Requirements Fulfilled:** FR-001, FR-030, NFR-019, NFR-023, NFR-024

## Dev Notes

### Epic Context

This story is part of **Epic 5: CLI Interface and User Experience**.

### Architecture Requirements

**Technology Stack:**
- Python 3.10+ (required for modern type hints)
- Standard library ONLY (NFR-016) - no external runtime dependencies
- Development dependencies: pytest, black, mypy (dev-time only)

**Code Quality Standards:**
1. Type hints on all functions (NFR-010, NFR-013)
2. Google-style docstrings (NFR-011)
3. Black formatting (NFR-012)
4. Pure functions for business logic (NFR-014)
5. ≥88% test coverage (NFR-009)
