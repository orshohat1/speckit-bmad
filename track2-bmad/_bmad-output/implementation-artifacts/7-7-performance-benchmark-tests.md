# Story 7.7: Performance Benchmark Tests

Status: ready-for-dev

## Story

As a developer,
I want performance benchmark tests that verify speed requirements,
So that I can confirm the system meets NFR-001 and NFR-002 targets.

## Acceptance Criteria

**Given** I have implemented the complete system
**When** I run performance tests
**Then** tests verify processing 15 events completes in <100ms

**And** tests verify processing 1000 events completes in <1s

**And** benchmarks measure actual execution time using time.perf_counter()

**And** benchmarks run multiple iterations for statistical confidence

**And** benchmarks are implemented in tests/test_integration.py or separate benchmark file

**And** all performance targets are met

**Requirements Fulfilled:** NFR-001, NFR-002, NFR-004

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Task 1: Implement core functionality (AC: all)
  - [ ] Subtask 1.1: Create necessary files/modules
  - [ ] Subtask 1.2: Implement main logic
  - [ ] Subtask 1.3: Add type hints and docstrings

- [ ] Task 2: Write comprehensive tests (AC: all)
  - [ ] Subtask 2.1: Write unit tests
  - [ ] Subtask 2.2: Write integration tests (if needed)
  - [ ] Subtask 2.3: Validate test coverage

- [ ] Task 3: Code quality validation (AC: all)
  - [ ] Subtask 3.1: Run mypy strict mode
  - [ ] Subtask 3.2: Run black formatter
  - [ ] Subtask 3.3: Verify all acceptance criteria met

## Dev Notes

### Epic Context

This story is part of **Epic 7: Testing, Performance, and Quality Assurance**.

### Architecture Requirements

**Technology Stack:**
- Python 3.10+ (required for modern type hints)
- Standard library ONLY (NFR-016) - no external runtime dependencies
- Development dependencies: pytest, black, mypy (dev-time only)

**Code Quality Standards:**
1. Type hints on all functions (NFR-010, NFR-013)
2. Google-style docstrings (NFR-011)
3. Black formatting (NFR-012)
4. Pure functions for business logic (NFR-014)
5. ≥88% test coverage (NFR-009)
