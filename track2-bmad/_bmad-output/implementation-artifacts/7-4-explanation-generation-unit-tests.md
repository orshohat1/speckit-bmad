# Story 7.4: Explanation Generation Unit Tests

Status: ready-for-dev

## Story

As a developer,
I want comprehensive unit tests for explanation generation,
So that all explanations are natural, complete, and accurate.

## Acceptance Criteria

**Given** I have implemented explanation generation functions
**When** I run the test suite
**Then** test_explanations.py contains tests for importance phrase generation

**And** tests verify personalization phrase generation

**And** tests verify context tag phrase generation

**And** tests verify complete explanation composition

**And** tests verify explanations are non-empty (100% coverage)

**And** tests verify explanation length (1-2 sentences)

**And** tests verify no technical jargon appears in explanations

**And** tests verify deterministic explanation generation

**And** tests are implemented in tests/test_explanations.py

**And** all tests pass successfully

**Requirements Fulfilled:** FR-014, FR-015, FR-016, NFR-007, NFR-008

## Dev Notes

### Epic Context

This story is part of **Epic 7: Testing, Performance, and Quality Assurance**.

### Architecture Requirements

**Technology Stack:**
- Python 3.10+ (required for modern type hints)
- Standard library ONLY (NFR-016) - no external runtime dependencies
- Development dependencies: pytest, black, mypy (dev-time only)

**Code Quality Standards:**
1. Type hints on all functions (NFR-010, NFR-013)
2. Google-style docstrings (NFR-011)
3. Black formatting (NFR-012)
4. Pure functions for business logic (NFR-014)
5. ≥88% test coverage (NFR-009)
