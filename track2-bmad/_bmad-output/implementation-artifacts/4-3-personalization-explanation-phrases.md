# Story 4.3: Personalization Explanation Phrases

Status: review

## Story

As a developer,
I want explanation phrases that reference player and team preferences,
So that users understand how their preferences influenced selection.

## Acceptance Criteria

**Given** I have a ScoreBreakdown with player_boost > 0
**When** I generate explanation text
**Then** I include a phrase like "featuring your favorite player, {player_name}"

**And** the phrase is omitted if player_boost = 0

**Given** I have a ScoreBreakdown with team_boost > 0
**When** I generate explanation text
**Then** I include a phrase like "by your favorite team, the {team_name}"

**And** the phrase is omitted if team_boost = 0

**And** phrases are generated by helper functions in selector.py

**And** functions include type hints and docstrings

**Requirements Fulfilled:** FR-015, FR-016, NFR-008

## Dev Notes

### Epic Context

This story is part of **Epic 4: Explanation Generation System**.

### Architecture Requirements

**Technology Stack:**
- Python 3.10+ (required for modern type hints)
- Standard library ONLY (NFR-016) - no external runtime dependencies
- Development dependencies: pytest, black, mypy (dev-time only)

**Code Quality Standards:**
1. Type hints on all functions (NFR-010, NFR-013)
2. Google-style docstrings (NFR-011)
3. Black formatting (NFR-012)
4. Pure functions for business logic (NFR-014)
5. ≥88% test coverage (NFR-009)
