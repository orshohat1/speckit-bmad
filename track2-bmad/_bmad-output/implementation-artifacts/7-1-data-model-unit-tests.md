# Story 7.1: Data Model Unit Tests

Status: ready-for-dev

## Story

As a developer,
I want comprehensive unit tests for all data models,
So that serialization, deserialization, and validation work correctly.

## Acceptance Criteria

**Given** I have implemented all data models (GameEvent, UserPreference, ScoreBreakdown, Highlight)
**When** I run the test suite
**Then** test_models.py contains tests for model instantiation

**And** tests verify type hints are correct (can run mypy)

**And** tests verify to_dict() serialization works for all models

**And** tests verify from_dict() deserialization works for all models

**And** tests verify round-trip serialization (obj == Model.from_dict(obj.to_dict()))

**And** tests verify edge cases (None values, missing fields)

**And** tests are implemented in tests/test_models.py

**And** all tests pass successfully

**Requirements Fulfilled:** FR-029, FR-030, NFR-010, NFR-011

## Dev Notes

### Epic Context

This story is part of **Epic 7: Testing, Performance, and Quality Assurance**.

### Architecture Requirements

**Technology Stack:**
- Python 3.10+ (required for modern type hints)
- Standard library ONLY (NFR-016) - no external runtime dependencies
- Development dependencies: pytest, black, mypy (dev-time only)

**Code Quality Standards:**
1. Type hints on all functions (NFR-010, NFR-013)
2. Google-style docstrings (NFR-011)
3. Black formatting (NFR-012)
4. Pure functions for business logic (NFR-014)
5. ≥88% test coverage (NFR-009)
